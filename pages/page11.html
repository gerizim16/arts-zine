        Estimated by some to have been seen on a billion computers globally, the default Windows XP wallpaper is said to be the
        most viewed digital image in history. Officially named "Bliss", the origin of this photo has mystified many people, some
        having suggested different locations as the actual site, and even others have speculated that the image was either not
        real, a combination of separate images, or a heavily modified photograph. Despite these theories, this image is a
        virtually unedited photograph of a hill and the sky taken in California.
