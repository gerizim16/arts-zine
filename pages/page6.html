    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The collaboration of an artist and an AI is something magical because the artwork produced may surprise the artist
        themself! This means that these artworks may never have existed as an idea in the human mind unlike before where
        everything thatâ€™s painted or drawn should exist in the mind first before executing it. This provokes the question of
        when does something made with an AI stop becoming art? Can an AI really produce art by itself?

        There will be varying opinions but by encompassing time from the long-established hand-drawing techniques to AI tools of
        the modern world, Scott shows that there is still more to explore about art which is very exciting.
