        It is easy
        on the eyes and does not take any attention away from what is supposed to be on the screen, making it effective as a
        background. The vibrant yet calming tones of the sky and the grass offers rest for the eyes of people working in front
        of their screens.

    <h2>Recent resurgence</h2>
    <p>
        With today's modern operating systems, Windows XP is slowly fading into obscurity, with only about <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/if-you-can-believe-it-millions-of-people-are-still-using-windows-xp">1 percent</a> of users
        running it. At its prime, Bliss was everywhere: now, it feels much like a distant memory.

        In April 2020, A YouTuber named float uploaded a video with the title "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqZEfqoTA7M">strangely familiar places with unnerving music</a>"
        which got 1.3 million views. Later, YouTuber Solar Sands uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63pQGhvK4M">a video</a> exploring these images of liminal spaces.
        These videos have caught the attention of many people (myself included), and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/">a community on Reddit</a> dedicated to liminal
        spaces has seen <a href="https://subredditstats.com/r/LiminalSpace">rapid growth</a>, from a thousand subscribers in April this year to 80 thousand today.

        From the comments on the videos and the discussions on Reddit, the general consensus is that these images tend to feel a
        bit empty, like we know that something is definitely off or missing. Solar Sands remarked in the video that some of
        these images have a nostalgic appeal, portraying relatively common situations minus the expected activity (for example,
        an empty house without the furniture or a cafeteria without the people and food).

        Bliss certainly has that appeal: a genuinely well-timed and well-executed photograph that has become part of people's
        collective memories. A photograph of a hill in California that has since been an icon of computers in the past
        generation and now serves as a reminder of the simpler times.
