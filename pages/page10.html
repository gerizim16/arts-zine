        I wondered how other people might listen to this piece, so I asked a friend what she thought about it. She said: “I see
        myself on a mountain watching a cellist play the song and it's really calm. despite feeling overwhelmed before this,
        this song makes me think that everything's going to be okay. If wisdom were to be in song form, this would be it!” To
        which I immensely agreed, citing my overpass anecdote. In hindsight, that day I needed a sensation that could calm my
        struggling and overwhelmed self. The piece’s build up resonated how my emotions were building up as well, and to my
        surprise the ending was a beautiful hopeful chord. After all, it is in a major key.

        In terms of my personal connection to the music score, in contrast to my technical analysis, I like how the melody
        starts off with a low (deep) bass note in each measure. To me, it gives a sense of being grounded. In the middle part of
        the song, one can symbolically relate as the melody was deviating and getting lost in different chords, but the fact
        that it still found its way back to its original melody and tonic chord makes the song more satisfying to listen to.

        After asking my friend, I did some more research about the piece to gain insight on others’ perspectives. It was moving
        to find what Yo-Yo Ma, a world-renowned (if not the most legendary) contemporary cellist, had to say about this solo. He
        said: “That piece, in some strange coded way that culture does, represents in many ways the water that is flowing right
        in front of us... It also represents when something very violent and tragic interpreted the flow...Then this piece also
        includes the rebuilding and the re-imagining of the better version of the very first.” To conclude, I think it might be
        more time-consuming to have to experience art via listening rather than looking because there are temporal limitations,
        but I like that one can close his/her eyes to possibly heighten hearing and immerse oneself deeper. Ultimately, no form
        of art consumption is superior to the other. For me, music can, without a doubt, invoke those emotions that help me feel
        tranquil as a river, or even aid in boosting my inner strength.
