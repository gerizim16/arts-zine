        In 2000, the developers of Windows XP contacted O'Rear through Corbis, wanting not only the license to use the image
        as
        their default wallpaper but also the full rights to it. According to him, Microsoft offered the second-largest
        payment
        ever made to an individual photographer for a single image (valued at reportedly "in the low six figures"). Due to
        its
        extremely high value, Microsoft had to pay for him to deliver the image personally to their offices in Seattle. The
        photo was also used as a focal point for the promotion of the operating system, making it possibly the most widely
        distributed photograph to date.

    <h2>The Photo</h2>
    <p>
        Despite his intent to take the photo the moment he saw the scenery, O'Rear claims that he did not "create" the image. He
        was just there at the right moment to capture it. There was an intent to take a good photo, and him uploading the
        photograph as a stock image for licensing meant that he thought there was some value to it, but he did not expect the
        photo to reach its level of popularity.

        Nonetheless, O'Rear's choice of camera and film definitely helped. He used a Mamiya RZ67 camera with Fujifilm Velvia
        film to capture the image, believing that this camera and film combination would make the image work better. The Velvia
        film was particularly known to saturate some colors more, giving the photo its signature greens and blues. Microsoft
        admitted to slightly intensifying the colors and cropping out a small portion of the left side of the image; aside from
        these, the photograph has been virtually untouched.

        Although O'Rear admitted that he wasn't sure why Microsoft chose the image, he suggested that they may have been looking
        for a peaceful image, one that had no tension. The gentle curves and the use of open space create a degree of
        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liminality">liminality</a>, a transitional space waiting to be filled with the icons and buttons of the Windows XP interface.
