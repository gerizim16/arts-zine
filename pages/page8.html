        As I cross the overpass that looks over Commonwealth, I pause right in the middle of the bridge. People walk past me.
        The world goes on yet mine stops for a moment that feels immeasurable with conventional units of time, as I vividly feel
        my chest hollow and my heart echoing the deep and rich vibrating tones produced by the cello as the piece <em style="font-weight: bold;">Cello Suite
        No.1 in G Major (by Johann Sebastian Bach)</em>, reaches its climax. Listen to it first! When you come back, can we talk about that very last measure? Beautiful.

        This piece never had a special place in my heart until this moment. I never appreciated it until the day I felt in tune
        with it. I suppose this is the case with most songs anyway, especially those pertaining to love. Whether it be its
        euphoric highs or the wretched heartbreak, people sing songs at the top of their lungs when it is most relatable to
        their experience/s or their current state of emotions. For my case, I chose to highlight this piece, that is under the
        Classical genre, as art because it gave me a feeling that was different from everyday emotions, or rather emotions
        obtained from social interactions. Something I couldn’t categorize and so I value differently, and in fact only really
        play to listen to when I am feeling like immersing myself in art.

        <em>The Prelude of the 1<sup>st</sup> Suite for unaccompanied cello</em> (the other name the piece is known as) by J.S. Bach is quite famous
        and used in many films and shows – to which I must close my eyes for and isolate the sound whenever it’s featured. I
        wouldn’t say that it has a particular mood or feeling, but it has a well-planned, cohesive structure that’s at the same
        time improvisatory. It adds tension just by exploring different harmonies, usually with pedal points, and resolves at
        the right time (and that goes for most of Bach’s works). The cello also fits as the instrument for the piece.
