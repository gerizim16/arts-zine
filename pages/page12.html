    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Veteran National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear was driving on a Friday afternoon in January 1996 along Sonoma
        Highway in Napa Valley (in California, north of San Francisco) to visit his girlfriend. O'Rear was on the lookout for a
        photo opportunity, as recent rains meant that the hills would be particularly lush and green.
        Along the highway, O'Rear found the perfect spot. The vineyards that used to cover the hills have been removed a few
        years ago (due to an infestation of phylloxera, a grape pest) and were replaced by a layer of grass. He stopped at the
        side of the road, set up his camera, took four shots, and went back to driving. Later, O'Rear then uploaded the image to
        Westlight (later acquired by Bill Gates' Corbis) as a stock photo.
