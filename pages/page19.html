        Sound effects will also usually follow the perspective or “action” of the scene. A jumping character executing a smooth
        serve will have the sound effect written behind him in clean lines; a shaky pass of the ball will be accompanied with a
        shakily written sound.

        Furudate’s shading also has a sneaky way of aiding the eye; instead of opaque black shadows, they’re done in clear
        strokes that follow the character’s movement, doubling as motion lines. Another effect is how Furudate uses the
        volleyball itself: The motion of the ball often reaches across the page, connecting two separate panels or perspectives.
        All these techniques are subtly effective, allowing the casual reader a more immersive experience without them even
        realizing it.

    <h2>Health, Happiness, and Volleyball</h2>

        Storywise, Furudate is an expert with motifs: Each team has a motto and mascot animal that molds their team strategies
        and beliefs, often long after they graduate. A match between two long-term rivals is suddenly a game of hunt between a
        cat and crow; the first perfect set and spike is turned into a metaphor for a bird’s first flight.

        And although volleyball is what drives the main plot, the story’s themes certainly go far beyond that. Even the most
        skilled players of the series might decide to pursue something else, take a step back, or quit entirely— <em>and that’s
        perfectly fine, Haikyu!! quietly tells us. What matters is that you’re happy.</em> Hinata’s first volleyball idol is later
        revealed to have quit, becoming a manga artist instead; and by the end of the series, one character who was said to be a
        prodigy in the earliest chapters, Yuu Nishinoya, isn’t a volleyball player at all. Personal happiness matters more than
        any construct of success.
