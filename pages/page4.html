        This process of photography to drawing to programming/teaching a CNN and finally drawing again with the help of the
        taught AI involves a diverse set of skills. Observing Scott and the AI at work is very mesmerizing as it shows the
        predictability of the AI; drawing what it infers be it a leg, arm, breast, head, or any other part that it learned; but
        still surprising when it tries to conform with the lines that Scott drew when it becomes very abstract. It feels like a
        dance with the artist’s lines and the AI’s persistence in producing a human body that corresponds to it.

        Most of the time, the final products of the artist are the only ones that are displayed for the audience to observe,
        understand, and appreciate. However, in this case, the elaborate process of Scott’s art is worth to be displayed as it
        explores the new tools we have in this modern world. It demonstrates how this new medium works and it educates the
        public about it. One of his main artworks, “Humanity” is a modern take to the famous painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Damned">“The Fall of the Damned”</a> by Peter Paul Rubens. Both are beautiful artworks that should not be compared because each have very different motives
        and context. “The Fall of the Damned” is a religious Baroque-style painting that depicts a passage from the Bible while
        “Humanity” is an AI-assited art that was made to showcase how a 17<sup>th</sup> century artwork would look like using new tools
        from the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

        “Humanity” features the amalgamation of Scott’s composition and forms, and the Bodies network’s shading and lighting
        techniques. Comparing Scott’s input to the output of the “Bodies network” shows what exactly is the capability and
        limitations of the AI. Each curve in Scott’s sketch is precisely placed to indicate forms and boundaries. He also shaded
        it carefully to express depth. When fed to the AI, it paints it according to the rules set by the artist, only doing
        what it is intended to do.
