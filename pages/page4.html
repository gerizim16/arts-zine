    <h2>Humanity (Fall of the Damned)</h2>
    <p>
        One of his main artworks, “Humanity” is a modern take to the famous painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Damned">“The Fall of the Damned”</a> by Peter
        Paul
        Rubens. It features the amalgamation of Scott’s composition and forms; and the Bodies network’s shading and lighting techniques.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The collaboration of an artist and an AI is something magical because the artwork produced may surprise the
        artist
        themself! This means that these artworks may never have existed as an idea in the human mind unlike before where
        everything that’s painted or drawn should exist in the mind first before executing it. This provokes the
        question of
        when does something made with an AI stop becoming art? Can an AI really produce art by itself?
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be varying opinions but by encompassing time from the long-established hand-drawing techniques to AI
        tools of
        the modern world, Scott shows that there is still more to explore about art.
