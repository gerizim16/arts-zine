        Manga, or comics and graphic novels from Japan, is a medium that seems like it’s been around forever. The art form is
        flexible yet distinct: Today almost anyone can recognize the Japanese art styles and influences seen in manga, and it
        covers every genre out there, from superhero action to simple slice of life.

        Just one example of how complex manga can become is Haikyu!!, a sports and coming-of-age manga. The 400-chapter series
        is about a boy who wants to be a volleyball player despite how short he is— that’s it. But something so oddly simple,
        even mundane, can be taken to incredible depths and heights in this story.
