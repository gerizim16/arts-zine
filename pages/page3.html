    <h2>The artist</h2>
    <p>
        Scott Eaton is a London-based artist whose art is mostly based on the human body and its anatomy in the form of
        drawings, digital sculptures, photographs, and AI-assisted art. He earned a master's degree from MIT Media Lab and
        worked as an animator for well-established companies such as Pixar, Disney, Sony, Microsoft, and Warner Bros. Recently,
        he changed his focus towards machine learning as a "creative collaborator" with his artistic process.
