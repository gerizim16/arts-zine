            Machines</span>

    <p>
        A relatively young medium of art is explored as Scott Eaton combines an artist's wit and a trained AI's
        computations.

    <h2>The artist</h2>
    <p>
        Scott Eaton is a London-based artist whose art is mostly based on the human body and its anatomy in the form of
        drawings, digital sculptures, photographs, and AI-assisted art. He earned a master's degree from MIT Media Lab
        and
        worked as an animator for well-established companies such as Pixar, Disney, Sony, Microsoft, and Warner Bros.
        Recently,
        he changed his focus towards machine learning as a "creative collaborator" with his artistic process.
    </p>
    <h2>The process</h2>
    <p>
        The particular AI tool that Scott Eaton used is called a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" target="_blank">convolutional neural
            network (CNN)</a>. A neural network is composed of thousands and up to millions of nodes that do simple math
        but when formed into a
        network, can do complex tasks. It essentially tries to mimic the human brain’s network of neurons. CNN is just a
        specialized form of neural network for dealing with images efficiently and effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, Scott has been training his CNN which he calls “Bodies neural network”. He did this by feeding
        it a
        well-lit picture of the naked human body he shot in his studio and a drawing of the picture in his style. Then,
        the
        “Bodies network” learns the correspondence between a human figure and his drawing style. Thus, this allows him
        to draw a
        stylized and almost abstract figure and use the “Bodies network” to infer the human anatomy and paint it.
