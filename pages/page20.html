        As a manga about sports, Haikyu!! also inevitably tackles health. When Hinata’s team loses their most important match
        yet after Hinata collapses from fever midway through, Hinata is forced to learn a lesson he’ll carry for the rest of his
        life: Happiness and success are useless if you don’t take care of yourself. Years into the future, he remains conscious
        of eating unhealthy food or overstraining himself. Many Olympic-level players of the series are the same, hammering down
        an oft-overlooked truth— success doesn’t need to come at the expense of your health. In fact, it’s the opposite: You’ll
        perform your best when you’re not overtired and weak.

        Furudate manages to tackle all these potentially-sad themes in a way that feels victorious and constructive, as
        characters eventually get through their conflict. All these themes are often not just one-time things: Haikyu!! circles
        back on them often, and it hits harder each time.
