        Haikyu!! is written by Haruichi Furudate, who worked on it for around eight years. As a kid, Furudate played the same
        sport and position as his determined protagonist. Still, happy, lighthearted sports mangas were not usually Furudate’s
        arena; their previous work was horror. And from time to time, it shows: Furudate knows how to make a highly-skilled
        character can look shockingly intimidating with a piercing look straight at the viewer.

    <h2>The Motion and Perspective in Haikyu’s Lines</h2>
    <p>
        On a visual and semiotic level, Furudate excels in controlling line and perspective. Haikyu!!’s medium is traditional
        ink, with chapter covers in watercolor. One of the most effective elements of Haikyu!! is its use of Japanese “sound
        effects” and volleyball nets as panel dividers. In fast-paced matches where guiding the reader’s eye is crucial, a
        well-placed sound effect can give the impression that two actions are occurring at the same time. A ball or a hand will
        sometimes reach beyond the panel, giving us the impression that it has reached the other side of the “net” in the match.
