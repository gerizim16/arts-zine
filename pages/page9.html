        I would say that I have some degree of understanding on music theory because I myself am particularly engaged in playing
        classical instruments. With a mix of knowledge from music class, my previous teachers, and passionate self-study, I can
        dissect classical music in some technical way. Having said that, the piece is not actually technically difficult.
        However, it is hard to present musically. Bach’s works have little to no dynamic markings added in the score, the piece
        has a consistent rhythm throughout, and it’s basically composed of arpeggiated chords. Playing it literally would make
        it sound boring. However, Bach explores harmony in this prelude that, as mentioned, gives tension and eventually
        resolves. That gives space for the performer to add color to the work. For example, sections with V/V chords would
        usually be more tense as those that do not belong to the tonic’s scale, and the performer could either go piano or forte
        depending on his understanding of the piece.

        In terms of technicality, I particularly like the section starting right before the final cadence. For build-up, would
        usually just stand on the dominant (i.e. D in this piece) then resolve on tonic I or submediant VI. Here, Bach used A as
        the pedal point right before using D, and the build-up is more supported by the chromatic scale leading to tonic. Also,
        even after it arrives to tonic, it continues using D as the not-quite pedal point and inverts the chord used at the
        first statement, making for an interestingly resolution. I enthusiastically suggest you give it another listen before
        reading the rest of this essay, so you understand what I meant about the resolution of the piece. The cello also best
        fits the piece for me as it is versatile with sound quality when it comes to playing low and mid-range notes. See,
        woodwinds in particular wouldn’t be able to play the low pedal points richly even if in their range, nor would other
        members of the string family.
